I propse that by beigin open about our numbers, in the same way that obese people are 'open' about theirs (weight not bg) increase awareness, remove the veil behing the healthy front and help poele stay in control , thereiy feel better and eductae others eventually convert them into supporting mnember of the very importantn network a diabetic needs to love.
